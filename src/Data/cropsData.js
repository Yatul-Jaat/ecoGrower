      introduction:
        "Tomatoes are warm-season crops that produce juicy fruits perfect for salads, sauces, and more. With proper care, each plant can yield pounds of delicious tomatoes throughout the growing season.",
      planting:
        "Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Transplant seedlings outdoors when soil temperatures reach 60°F. Plant seedlings deeper than they were in containers, burying part of the stem to encourage additional root growth.",
      care: "Water deeply but infrequently, aiming for 1-2 inches per week. Prune suckers for indeterminate varieties to improve air circulation. Support plants with cages or stakes as they grow. Apply organic mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.",
      fertilizing:
        "Apply balanced organic fertilizer when planting. Side-dress with compost or organic fertilizer once plants begin to flower and again when fruit begins to form. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which promotes foliage over fruit production.",

        "Monitor for aphids and hornworms regularly. Remove affected leaves at first sign of disease. Maintain good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal issues. Consider row covers for early protection.",
      harvesting:
        "Harvest when fruits are firm and fully colored. Pick in the morning for best flavor. Most varieties continue producing until frost kills the plants. Store at room temperature for best flavor - refrigeration diminishes taste.",
      tips: "Plant in a different location each year to prevent soil-borne disease buildup. Save seeds from heirloom varieties for next year's crop. Try different varieties to discover which perform best in your specific growing conditions.",

      planting:
        "Plant from cuttings, divisions, or nursery starts rather than seeds for true-to-type plants. Plant in spring after danger of frost has passed. Contain plants in buried pots or dedicated beds to prevent spreading. Space 18-24 inches apart to allow for growth.",
      care: "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Pinch growing tips to encourage bushy growth. Cut plants back by half if they become leggy. Divide plants every 2-3 years to maintain vigor. Mulch to retain moisture and reduce weed competition.",
      fertilizing:
        "Apply compost when planting. Mint generally doesn't require heavy feeding. Apply balanced organic fertilizer in spring when new growth appears. Side-dress with compost midway through growing season for continuous production.",
      pests_diseases:
        "Watch for spider mites in hot, dry conditions. Provide good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Remove rust-infected leaves promptly. Ensure adequate drainage to prevent root diseases.",
      harvesting:
        "Begin harvesting when plants are 4-6 inches tall. Harvest sprigs by cutting stems just above a leaf node to encourage branching. Morning harvest provides highest essential oil content. For drying, harvest just before flowering for maximum flavor.",
      tips: "Grow in containers to control spreading. Try different varieties for unique flavors - peppermint, spearmint, chocolate mint, apple mint. Use fresh or dried in teas, desserts, and savory dishes. Freeze in ice cubes with water or olive oil for later use.",
